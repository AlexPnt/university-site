We had been together for some time. I guess we were in love but now… now I cannot stand her!
 
I want the procedure done so I can move on with my life!”

I can’t believe she did it to me!

Would I have subjected myself to the procedure if she had not done it first? 

Oh Clem! You're such an impulsive person…

Some memories are so precious… I don’t wanna  loose them.

Epilogue

This is it. It's going to be gone soon.

It would be different, if we could just give it another go-round...

Clementine: Remember me. Try your best! Maybe we can.
