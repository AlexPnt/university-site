Photo1:
Today I woke up in a funk.
I don't know... I just feel empty!


Photo2:
I ditched work today.

Photo3:
Took a train out to the beach.
I don't know why...
I'm not an impulsive person.


Photo4:
Really? Beach in the winter?!
What was I thinking?


Photo5:
But then I met her!

Photo6:
This girl... we talk for hours and hours!
It feels like I've been known her all my life!


Photo7:
We spent the all day together.

Photo8:
Parting never felt so difficult...


Bonecos:
Could she be the one?
My soulmate...
